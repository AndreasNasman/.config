# This script creates whatis databases to speed up man page lookups.
# `:Telescope man_pages` uses `apropos` on Mac, which can utilize the whatis
# databases to speed up the process.
#
# It also updates the MANPATH environment variable in Neovim that Telescope
# uses to prevent reading invalid paths, i.e., paths where we can not create a
# whatis database.
#
# Whether we launch kitty and fish through Raycast or Aerospace, `manpath`
# contains duplicate or faulty entries, but the command still works fine.
