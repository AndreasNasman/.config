# This script focuses the first app window and cycles through windows
# (backward) on consecutive runs. It also opens an app window if none is
# opened yet.
#
# We have to cycle through the windows backward since a window is moved first
# in the list of windows in yabai when it receives focus. When app windows are
# cycled through with multiple displays, the order of windows changes a bit
# more, but the list can still be traversed backward to focus all apps in
# succession.
