# This script changes focus to the app given as an argument. It cycles backward
# through the app's windows for consecutive runs and opens an app window if
# none is found.
#
# We have to cycle through the windows backward since a window is moved first
# in the list of windows when it receives focus in yabai. When cycling through
# windows on multiple displays, the order of windows in the list could be more
# logical, but the script can still traverse the list backward to focus all
# apps in succession.
